**Sanity checks**
- [ ] I have personally confirmed that the content I want is no longer available
- [ ] I have personally checked the repository hasn't just been renamed
- [ ] I understand that any defrosted content is unsupported and provided as-is

**Content URL, previous repository name, or project description**
If you have a broken link, fill in the URL. Failing that, if you know the name of the repository, fill it in here, and if you don't, then just describe what it does and I'll try to figure it out.

**What you want from the repository**
Think about what you really need. If it's just one file, tell me which file. Entire repositories will only be restored if there's sufficient justification, and this is the place to tell me about that justification.

**Where you found the link to, or details of, the unavailable content**
Telling me where you found the link, or were otherwise referred to the content, will let me try to get it pointed at its new location in the boneyard.

**Any other details**
If therea
