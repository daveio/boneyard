**Sanity checks**
- **I have personally confirmed that the content I want is no longer available** <Yes/No>
- **I have personally checked the repository hasn't just been renamed** <Yes/No>
- **I understand that any defrosted content is unsupported and provided as-is** <Yes/No>

**Content location details**
If you have a broken link, fill in the URL. Failing that, if you know the name of the repository, fill it in here, and if you don't, then just describe what it does and I'll try to figure it out.

**Content requested**
Request what you need, but no more. If it's just one file, tell me which file. Entire repositories will only be restored if there's sufficient justification, and this is the place to tell me about that justification.

**Referral details**
Telling me where you found the link, or were otherwise referred to the content, will let me try to get it pointed at its new location in the boneyard.

**Any other information**
If there's any other information that would be helpful, this is the place for it.
