# `proxmark3-install-script`

The file `pm3-setup.sh` in this directory is my Proxmark3 installer script. Originally written for Ubuntu 14.04, it won't run without modification on later distributions. If you want to use it you'll need to make the requisite modifications. Feel free to submit a PR with your updated version if you like - just because I've retired it doesn't mean it can't be contributed to!
